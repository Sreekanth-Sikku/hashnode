> ### Robert C. Martin, the author of Clean Code, said: "Truth can only be found in one place: the code."

### History.

Java is a programming language that was born out of a desire to make electronic devices talk to each other.

In 1991, a team of engineers at Sun Microsystems, led by [<mark>James Gosling</mark>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP7n8k9Mzcc), started working on a project called Green, which aimed to create a language for smart appliances.

However, they soon realized that their language, which they named Oak, could also be used for web development. In 1995, they renamed it Java and released it to the world.

Java quickly became one of the most popular and influential languages, thanks to its features such as object-oriented, platform-independent, and multithreaded.

### Present day Scenario.

Today it is the most widely used programming language after Javascript and Python. See this -&gt; Most used languages among software developers globally 2023 | Statista.

It is used in,

* Video Games
    
* Desktop Applications
    
* Web Applications
    
* Internet-of-Things.
    
* Android Applications
    
* Big Data.

Many big organizations like Spotify, Twitter( Elon renamed this to X), LinkedIn use Java to create applications that serve millions of users, if not billions.

### So, What next for JAVA?

The future of Java is very bright. Just type in the words "Java Developer" in linkedIn or some other job portals and see for yourself. Java is going to be here for lot many years. No matter how many tools like ChatGPT or Github's Copilot come, Java never fades away and demands these tools to learn Java programming. Learn Java for a great career in a great organization.

> The fight between Java, Python and Javascript never ends and be smart enough to not indulge in that fight.
